[Subject]
- Bio-signal Analysis from Wearable Device
- Developing an Application for Medical Service

[Contents]
- Developing an LSTM-CNN Model to Predicting Personalized Wake-up Time by Analysing Sleep Patterns
- Integrating IoT devices on the App to Operate in Conjunction with User's Personalized Wake-up Time

[Program Languages]
- Python, MYSQL

[Idea] 
- The Sleeping Stages Cycle Order is divided into N1, N2, N3, N2, and REM Each cycle lasts around 90–110 minutes
- This Project, Sleeping Cycle is Labeled into Four-Stages (Awake, REM, Core, and Deep) Detecting Awake Time is Labeled as "Core"

[Service]
- Service Title: Lite-Right
- Polit Web: by Streamlit
- App : by Swift, Xcode
